Human Interventions Required for Modules 1 and 2

Based on modules 1 and 2, the human interventions required are:

Module 1:
- Install Flutter 3.32.5: Download and extract SDK, add to PATH.
- Set up editor: Install Android Studio, Flutter/Dart extensions, run flutter doctor and resolve issues.
- Create project: Run `flutter create ecommerce_app`.
- Install CLIs: Run `npm install -g firebase-tools` and `dart pub global activate flutterfire_cli` (with troubleshooting for PowerShell/git issues).
- Log in to Firebase: Run `firebase login` and authenticate in browser.
- Configure Firebase: Run `flutterfire configure`, create project, select android/web platforms.
- Add package: Run `flutter pub add firebase_core`.

Module 2:
- Create logo: Design or download 1024x1024 PNG for app icon.
- Generate icons: Use online tool (e.g., App Icon Generator), upload logo, select Android, download zip.
- Replace icons: Unzip and copy mipmap folders to android/app/src/main/res/.
- Add splash image: Place 1200x1200 PNG in assets/images/splash_logo.png.
- Generate splash: Run `dart run flutter_native_splash:create`.
- Rebuild app: Run `flutter run` for fresh build to see icon/splash changes.

Module 3:
- Create file structure: Manually create lib/screens/ folder and login_screen.dart/signup_screen.dart files.
- Update main.dart: Add import for login_screen.dart and change home to LoginScreen.
- Implement login_screen.dart: Write the StatefulWidget code with Form, TextFormFields, validators, ElevatedButton (with print logic), and TextButton navigation.
- Implement signup_screen.dart: Copy login_screen.dart code, modify imports, class names, AppBar title, button text, and navigation to LoginScreen.
- Test: Run `flutter run` to verify UI, validation, and navigation between screens.

Module 4:
- Add package: Run `flutter pub add firebase_auth`.
- Enable authentication: Manually log into Firebase Console, open the project, go to Authentication > Sign-in method, enable Email/Password, and save.

These are manual steps outside code implementation.
