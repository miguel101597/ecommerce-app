Module 1: Project Setup (Flutter 3.32.5) & Firebase Integration
In this first module, we will set up your development environment specifically with Flutter 3.32.5. We'll create a new project and connect it to a Firebase project using the modern flutterfire_cli tool. 
This will handle all our configuration files (like google-services.json and web configs) automatically.

1.	Install Flutter 3.32.5:
○	Go to the Flutter SDK archive.
○	Find version 3.32.5 for your operating system (Windows, macOS, or Linux) and download the .zip file.
○	Extract the flutter folder to a permanent location on your computer (e.g., C:\flutter or ~/development/flutter).
○	Add this folder to your system's PATH.
2.	Set up your Editor & Doctor:
○	Install (Android Studio) and add the official Flutter and Dart extensions.
○	Open your terminal (or the terminal in Android Studio) and run flutter doctor. This will check your setup. Follow any instructions it gives (like installing Android Studio or Chrome) until all checks pass.
3.	Create the Flutter Project:
○	In your terminal, navigate (cd) to the folder where you want to save your projects.
Run the command:

flutter create ecommerce_app




○	This creates a new folder ecommerce_app. Open this folder in Android Studio.
○	Note: With Flutter 3.32.5, your Android project will use the Kotlin-based build scripts (.kts). This is normal and you'll see files like build.gradle.kts instead of just build.gradle.

4.	Install Firebase & FlutterFire CLIs:
○	These are command-line tools. You'll need Node.js installed to run npm.
In your terminal, run:

# Installs the main Firebase tools
npm install -g firebase-tools

!!! If you encounter this error !!!!

It means the"running scripts is disabled" (PowerShell ExecutionPolicy) when running npm
Cause: PowerShell execution policy blocks scripts (npm ships npm.ps1).

npm : File C:\Program Files\nodejs\npm.ps1 cannot be loaded because running 
scripts is disabled on this system. For more information, see 
about_Execution_Policies at https:/go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=135170.
At line:1 char:1
+ npm install -g firebase-tools
+ ~~~
    + CategoryInfo          : SecurityError: (:) [], PSSecurityException
    + FullyQualifiedErrorId : UnauthorizedAccess


Open the powershell terminal and type this command

Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope CurrentUser

Then re-run this command

npm install -g firebase-tools

# Installs the FlutterFire tool
dart pub global activate flutterfire_cli

!!! If you encounter this error you need to install git and restart your  android studio !!!
Error: Unable to find git in your PATH. 


If you encounter this warning,
Warning: Pub installs executables into C:\Users\AppData\Local\Pub\Cache\bin, which is not on your path.
You can fix that by adding that directory to your system's "Path" environment variable.
A web search for "configure windows path" will show you how.

NOTE:
 ( this is example only, please check your terminal cache bin location )

You need to copy the cache bin file location,

Here are the steps.

Step 1 : Search at the windows search bar the keyword EN
Step 2: click the Environment Variables
Step 3: Under the User Variables double click the PATH variable
Step 4: Click “New” and paste the cache bin location and click “ok”
Step 5: close your android studio and open again. 
Step 6: Open the android studio terminal and arrow up to run again the syntax dart pub global activate flutterfire_cli
Step 7: Make sure the warning does not appear again. If it still shows up after running the command, try using a different terminal for your Flutter project or double-check the spelling of  your cache bin.

5.	Log in to Firebase: 
Run this command. It will open a browser window for you to log in with your Google account.
firebase login

6.	Configure Firebase for your App:
○	Make sure you are in your project's root folder (cd ecommerce_app).
Run the configuration command:

flutterfire configure
○	This will guide you:
■	It will ask you to "Create a new project". Select this option.
■	Enter a Project ID (e.g., my-ecommerce-app-123).
■	It will ask which platforms to register. Use the spacebar to select android and web. Press Enter.
○	This one command automatically does everything:
■	Creates the project in the Firebase console.
■	Creates an Android app in your project and places the android/app/google-services.json file.
■	Creates a Web app in your project.
■	Generates a single config file lib/firebase_options.dart that holds the configuration for all platforms.

7.	Add Firebase Core Package:
Now we add the first Firebase package to our Flutter app.

flutter pub add firebase_core

○	This will add the latest compatible firebase_core package to your pubspec.yaml file.
If you encounter this error
Building with plugins requires symlink support.

Please enable Developer Mode in your system settings. Run
  start ms-settings:developers
to open settings.

Open your terminal, copy and run this command
start ms-settings:developers
Your window settings will open and enable the developer mode 
A pop up window will open and click YES to turn on the developer mode and re-run again the flutter pub add firebase_core

8.	Initialize Firebase in main.dart:
○	Open the file lib/main.dart. We need to modify it to initialize Firebase before the app runs.
________________________________________
lib/main.dart
Let's modify the default main.dart file. I'll break it into parts as you requested.

Part 1: Imports
First, add the new imports at the top of the file.
// This imports all the standard Material Design widgets
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';

// 1. Import the Firebase core package
import 'package:firebase_core/firebase_core.dart'; 
// 2. Import the auto-generated Firebase options file
import 'firebase_options.dart'; 

●	firebase_core.dart: This gives us access to the Firebase.initializeApp() method, which is needed to connect to our Firebase project.
●	firebase_options.dart: This is the file that flutterfire configure created. It contains all the API keys and project IDs for both Android and web.
Part 2: The main() function
Next, we must update the main() function to be async and await the Firebase initialization.
void main() async { // 1. Make the 'main' function asynchronous
  
  // 2. Ensure Flutter is ready before calling native code
  WidgetsFlutterBinding.ensureInitialized(); 
  
  // 3. Initialize Firebase
  await Firebase.initializeApp(
    // 4. Use the options from our generated file
    options: DefaultFirebaseOptions.currentPlatform, 
  );
  
  // 5. Run the app (this line is already here)
  runApp(const MyApp());
}

●	async: This keyword allows us to use await inside the function.
●	WidgetsFlutterBinding.ensureInitialized(): This is a mandatory line. It ensures that the connection between the Flutter framework and the native platform (Android/iOS) is ready before we try to initialize Firebase.
●	await Firebase.initializeApp(...): This is the most important line. It tells the app to "wait" here until the Firebase connection is complete before moving on to runApp.
●	options: DefaultFirebaseOptions.currentPlatform: This is a brilliant helper from the firebase_options.dart file. It automatically detects if you're running on Android or web and provides the correct Firebase keys for that platform.
Part 3: The MyApp Widget (No changes needed, just explanation)
The rest of the file is our MyApp widget. We'll leave it as-is for now, but we'll add a placeholder Scaffold to show our app is working.

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  const MyApp({super.key});

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    // 1. MaterialApp is the root of your app
    return MaterialApp(
      // 2. This removes the "Debug" banner
      debugShowCheckedModeBanner: false, 
      title: 'eCommerce App',
      theme: ThemeData(
        primarySwatch: Colors.deepPurple,
      ),
      // 3. A simple placeholder for our home screen
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('My E-Commerce App'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: Text('Firebase is Connected!'),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

●	MaterialApp: This is the main widget that holds your entire application. It sets up navigation, themes, and more.
●	debugShowCheckedModeBanner: false: A helpful line to remove the "Debug" banner from the top-right corner.
●	home: Scaffold(...): The home property defines the first screen the user sees. We're using a Scaffold (a basic screen layout widget) as a temporary placeholder.
________________________________________
Expected Output
Run the app from your Android Studio terminal:

flutter run -d chrome  # To run on web
# OR
flutter run            # To run on your Android emulator

1.	The app should build and launch.
2.	You will see a screen with a deep purple app bar titled "My E-Commerce App".
3.	The body of the app will show the text "Firebase is Connected!".
4.	Most importantly, check your Debug Console in Android Studio You should see some Firebase logging messages and no red errors. This confirms the connection is successful.
