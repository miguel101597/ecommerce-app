We will take the e-commerce app we've built and install it on your physical Android phone. 
Building a Release .apk: Creating a single .apk file that you can share with friends or upload to Google Drive.
Create a Shareable .apk File (Release Build)
This is the final step to create a single file you can send to other people.
1.	Open your android studio terminal.
2.	(Optional but recommended) Run flutter clean to clear old build files.

flutter build apk --release

3.	This will take a few minutes. Flutter is compiling and optimizing your entire app.

4.	When it's finished, it will print a message showing you where the file is.

5.	Navigate to your project folder:
○	Go to build -> app -> outputs -> flutter-apk.
○	Inside this folder, you will find app-release.apk.
This .apk file is your app!
You can now:
●	Install the APK file into your android phone
(Note: Anyone who installs this will need to enable "Install from unknown sources" on their Android phone, since it's not coming from the Google Play Store.)
Congratulations!
You have successfully built, debugged, and refined a complete e-commerce application from scratch, complete with:

●	A real-time Chat System with unread counts
●	A real-time Notification System
●	A professional, branded UI with a custom theme
